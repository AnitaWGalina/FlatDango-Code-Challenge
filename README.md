# FlatDango-code-challenge
This code challenge that allows users to purchase movie-tickets from the theatre.To implement this I used a GET request to display the movie's details.
Implemented a sold out button using an event listener function , that displays sold out when there are zero tickets left.Using a placeholder , implemented the movie items to the left.
